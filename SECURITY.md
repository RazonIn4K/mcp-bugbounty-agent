# Security Policy

## üîí Security & Compliance Overview

The MCP Bug Bounty Research Agent is designed with security-first principles and compliance with modern AI and data protection regulations.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Architecture

### Data Protection
- **Zero Persistence**: Target data is not stored permanently on our systems
- **Encryption in Transit**: All API communications use TLS 1.3

### Access Controls
- **API Key Authentication**: Premium features require valid subscription keys
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse and DoS
- **Scope Validation**: Automated checks for authorized testing targets
- **Permission Verification**: Users must confirm authorization before testing

### Docker Isolation
- **Container Sandboxing**: All testing runs in isolated Docker containers
- **Network Segmentation**: Testing traffic isolated from production systems
- **Resource Limits**: Containers have strict CPU, memory, and storage limits
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Containers destroyed after testing completion

## üìã Compliance Frameworks

### GDPR Compliance (EU General Data Protection Regulation)

- **Purpose Limitation**: Data used only for authorized vulnerability research
- **Storage Limitation**: Maximum 90-day retention policy
- **Transparency**: Clear disclosure of data collection and usage
- **User Rights**: Support for data access, correction, and deletion requests

### SOC 2 Type II (In Progress - Q3 2025)
- **Security**: Comprehensive security controls and monitoring
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime SLA for premium services
- **Processing Integrity**: Accurate and complete vulnerability research
- **Confidentiality**: Protection of sensitive customer and target data
- **Privacy**: Controls for personal information handling

### EU AI Act Compliance
- **Transparency**: Clear disclosure of AI capabilities and limitations
- **Human Oversight**: Human-in-the-loop for critical security decisions
- **Bias Mitigation**: Regular testing for algorithmic bias in vulnerability detection
- **Risk Assessment**: Continuous evaluation of AI system risks
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive AI model documentation and lineage

### ISO 27001 (Planned - Q4 2025)
- **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**
- **Risk Assessment and Treatment**
- **Security Control Implementation**
- **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement**
